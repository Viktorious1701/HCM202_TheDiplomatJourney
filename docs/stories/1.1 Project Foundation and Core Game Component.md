### **Story 1.1: Project Foundation and Core Game Component**

**Status:** Draft

**Story**
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to set up a new React TypeScript project with all necessary dependencies,
*   **so that** I have a stable foundation to build the game application.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1.  A new React project is created using Vite with the TypeScript template.
2.  A main `<Game />` component is created and renders a simple "Hello World" message.
3.  A `story.json` file is created in `src/data/` with a placeholder "start" node.
4.  Linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier) are configured and operational.

**Tasks / Subtasks**
*   [ ] Initialize a new project using Vite (`npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`).
*   [ ] Install ESLint and Prettier dependencies.
*   [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier rules according to the architecture document.
*   [ ] Clean the default Vite template files (`App.css`, `App.tsx`, assets).
*   [ ] Create the main application component at `src/App.tsx`.
*   [ ] Create a placeholder `<Game />` component that renders "Hello World".
*   [ ] Render the `<Game />` component within `App.tsx`.
*   [ ] Create the `src/data/story.json` file with a minimal starting structure.
*   [ ] Verify that the application runs successfully with `npm run dev`.

**Dev Notes**
This story establishes the entire technical foundation of the project. All work must adhere to the Frontend Architecture Document.

*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Framework:** React v18.x
    *   **Language:** TypeScript v5.x
    *   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Project Structure:** The initial file structure must match the one defined in the architecture document. Key files to create are:
    ```plaintext
    /src
    ├── data/
    │   └── story.json
    ├── views/
    │   └── Game.tsx  // Placeholder component for now
    ├── App.tsx
    └── main.tsx
    ```
*   **`story.json` Initial Content:**
    ```json
    {
      "start": {
        "text": "The journey begins...",
        "choices": []
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Developer Standards:**
    *   ESLint and Prettier must be configured to enforce consistent code style.
    *   All new files must adhere to the `PascalCase.tsx` naming convention for components.

**Testing**
*   No specific application tests are required for this story, as it is foundational.
*   The primary validation is confirming that the development environment starts without errors and that the linter and formatter run correctly.
